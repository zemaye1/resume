\textbf{WORK EXPERIENCE}\\

\textbf{Intercontinental Exchange - owner of New York Stock Exchange} C++ developer 2024-2025
\begin{itemize}
\item In C++ troubleshooted unenriched messages coming down from the backend and fixed multiple bugs on a massively distributed datastream pipeline with multiple sinks and sources of high throughput international financial data streams constituting trades from nearly every exchange in the world with the advanced data structures of the C++ standard library 
\item Profiled and researched the asynchronous code in datastream pipeline graphing out performance metrics in C++.
\item Built custom metric included binaries using thread sanitizer and helgrind to identify contention and testing for performance on live data and identifying lock unlock semantics which were causing a slowdown
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Open Source Exploration} mid 2020-2024
\begin{itemize}
\item Attended conference in
Styria, Graz focusing on different computer security topics over the
course of a week
\item Independently worked on operating systems projects to
gain a richer understanding of machines
\item Researched Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) to reset the root password on
computers on which it was forgotten
\item Followed along the libre-soc project synthesizing their work on an FPGA
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Bloomberg Terminal Instant Bloomberg (IB) Realtime Messaging
System} 2015-mid 2020

\textbf{Infrastructure Engineer} : \emph{Performant Distributed Systems
in C++}
\begin{itemize}
\item Deployment, operation, maintenance, and migration to next-gen realtime
messaging platform -- highly available and transactional distributed
system compliant with auditing requirements of global financial
regulations. The Bloomberg terminal is Bloomberg's flagship product
trading platform which accounts for a large percentage of daily trading
volume around the world with over 300,000 subscribers taking advantage
of Bloomberg's world-class service.

\item Responsible for maintenance, deployment of the framework for running the
Instant Bloomberg real-time mes- saging and trading platform operating
in an environment with strong auditing and compliance requirements.
Participated in client migration from legacy to new infrastructure with
zero downtime.

\item Increased system throughput by over 5x enabling growth in userbase
\item Built a general purpose filter framework with composable message filters
so that new filters could be added with quick code snippets to drop
messages of a certain class with particular traits in message streams
Wrote reconnect logic for RabbitMQ message streams with exponential
backoff for migratory path backup system
\item Greatly improved dev environment experience on the shared dev
distributed systems setup by writing a Perl script which automated new
config deployment with hourly Jenkins builds: configs were often edited
and dev environment needed to pick up the new changes so that anyone
testing on that environment would have a working enviornment and be
testing on the latest build.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Bloomberg Reliability Engineer}:
\emph{Monitoring Frameworks: Chaos Testing System in Python using Kafka,
Pandas Time-series Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item Using Bloomberg's monitoring framework which produced timeseries data,
wrote an metric tool in Pandas for teams looking to do trend analysis
and answer questions about their metric streams regarding uptime and
traffic of their services. Time series data-wrangling.

\item Performed independent research to create a robust notion of uptime using
historical trends, seasonality, and data mining to define realistic
SLI/SLO's
\item Researched and presented a paper on fault management strategies and null
intervals to illustrate the importance of thinking about the systems are
that are doing the monitoring
\item Rearchitected the framework's heartbeat protocol of the Chaos Testing
Framework for better fault handling by getting rid of SYN-ACK and using
heartbeats with timestamps to enable a stateless controller
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Bloomberg Developer Experience Features}: \emph{Chromium Shims
in Javascript} 2017-Sep 2020
\begin{itemize}
\item Lead developer on producing the first working implementation of a chat
entry on top of blink that did more than parse plaintext strings, opting
instead for dynamic composition of metadata as a step towards rich text
entry. Found a bug in Chromium which was submitted and fixed.

\item Responsible for deployment, productionization, and maintenance of
next-gen chat entry
\item Independently architected a chat entry framework that allows metadata to
be mapped to parts of text by extracting editing operations from cursor
movement to construct a data model
\item Beautifully integrated framework, slim javascript layer on top of the
blink engine, thoughtful event catching to preserve native speeds and
reactive workflows. Became the basis for all metadata workflows and the
celebrated at-mentions product which has seen strong adoption. Built out
the plumbing for rich messages in C++.

See
businessinsider.com/bloomberg-terminal-instant-chat-changes-updates-collaboration-messenger-2021-9
\item Introduced containerization and local development to the team
\item Curated and moderated a technical chat list that was company-recognized
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Bloomberg Full Stack Work}: \emph{API Design and Microservice
Architecture}
\begin{itemize}
\item Collaborated in designing an API for external teams to post into IB,
thinking for extensibility by following a domain driven model. Then used
the API in architecting the World Problem (WP) framework for incident
management to create self joinable rooms from inside a WP ticket. On
production since 2020, aiding in solving over 1700 World Problems
\item Responsible for architecting, maintenance, operations, API design of
three new frameworks under the new paradigm: Third-party Apps, World
Problem Chat, @Mentions which were all on stable releases
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Bloomberg Data Scientist}: \emph{Dataset creation and NLP
algorithms in Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn} 2018 - 2019

learning-to-rank algorithm using lambdaMART; advised by NLP Architect
Amanda Stent
\item Novel dataset creation method, labeling, and cleaning from stack
exchange question-answer-pairs and technical chat discussions
\item Returned relevant results within the first 3 hits on average for complex
proprietary queries for good recall and precision
